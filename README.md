# lyricsscrape
There are two implementations to this program. One uses the lyricsgenius wrapper the other uses beautifulsoup that parses the lyrics from genius lyrics website.
The problem with beautiful soup is that the url ust be perfect or else it will cause an error. Therefore it is easier to use lyricsgenius. Soon will implement that if the url build is incorrect and causes an error, then the program will use lyricsgenius.

work in progress
